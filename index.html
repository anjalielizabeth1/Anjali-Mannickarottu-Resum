        <div class="subheading mb-5">BiologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second year biology major on the pre-medical track. Since a child, I have been looking forward to becoming a doctor. I would like to one day save lives ad alleviate human suffering starting with a few individuals then focusing on the community at large. I hope to contribute to medical research, disease/injury prevention, and public health initiatives. Creating meaningful and trusting relationships with patients is also important in the healthcare field as then are trusting us with their life and future. I am currently a volunteer at Riverside Community Hospital where we are assigned tasks like bathing, feeding and ambulating patients. Often, I sit with patients for hours just to speak with them or feed them. Some patients are not able to swallow properly, so I take that extra step and spoon feed any liquids such as water, orange juice or protein shake. If I was in their position, I would want someone looking over me and protecting my dignity. Patients are often sad or nervous in the hospital and it is our duty as healthcare workers to ensure their safety and comfort. I have learned that it is important to personalize care for each individual in the hospital. A successful professional career is built on a solid foundation of knowledge, skills, and experience. It involves setting clear goals, making strategic decisions, and seizing opportunities for advancement. A professional career demands integrity, professionalism, and a strong work ethic.<br><br>

        Throughout my high school and college career, I have taken on various community service opportunities and customer service jobs. I have worked at a pizza place, receptionist for a dentist, Chickfila and Tillys. Each of these jobs have taught me more about myself and how to interact others than any other opportunity I have had. In these settings, we are often stuck in a position where we may not know the answer to the problem. It is important to recognize that we are imperfect and will often encounter this, but we should strive to find someone to mentor us who may have the answer to the problem. Problem-solving encourages growth in learning as we examine the situation from different perspectives and explore creative solutions, We can expand our knowledge, develop new skills and broaden our understanding of the world.
<br><br>

        I have taken on various leadership positions in the clubs and organizations I am a part of including but not limited to PACE chairwoman and recruitment coordinator. PACE chairwoman takes on the role of presenting any topic of my choosing that I may think would benefit our chapter. As a recruitment coordinator, I send out application deadline reminders and outreach to many schools and clubs searching for prospective health scholars for the volunteering program. PACE and my recruitment position have both given me public speaking skills and people skills. I have been playing volleyball and going to the gym since the 4th grade which has all taught me that nothing in life will come easy and it is my choice and responsibility to put in the work to see the results I am seeking.
